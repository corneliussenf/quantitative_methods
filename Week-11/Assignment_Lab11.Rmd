**Run a global PCA model**

Download the dataset bioclim.tif from moodle (it's in a zip-file). It contains a raster stack with 19 layers of global climate variables. See http://www.worldclim.org/bioclim for the variable declaration.

1) Run a PCA model on the global bioclim data set (using a sample) (3 Points): 

```{r}

```

Apply the PCA to the raster stack. Beforehand, decide how many components to use by looking at the explained variance (3 Points): 

```{r}

```

Map each component and decide for a decent name (e.g., north-south gradient, monsoon, etc.) (4 Points):

```{r}

```
