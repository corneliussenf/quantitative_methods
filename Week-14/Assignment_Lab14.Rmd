**Relationship between Picea Abies climate**

1) Calculate the count of Abies alba trees within each Bioclim grid cell (3 Points): 

Load the abies alba data and the bioclim data set used in Week 12. Create a new raster counting the number of Abies alba occurences in each grid cell.

```{r}

```

2) Create a data frame from the data (3 Points): 

Stack the bioclim and count raster. Convert the stack into a data frame where each row equals one pixel. Remove NAs. Finally, create a stratified sample containing 10% of the observations in each count class. Hint: You can combine dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::sample_frac()!

```{r}

```

3) Build a model predicting the count of Picea Abies (3 Points)

Use a Poisson model for predicting the occurence of picea abies from bioclom. Either hand-select a variable combination or run a PCA model.

```{r}

```

4) Create a map of Picea abies counts (1 Point)

```{r}

```
